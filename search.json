Finger tapping involves a finger indicating the pulse of an external periodic stimulus, similar to when you follow the beat of the music with your foot. The time delay between the response tap and the corresponding stimulus is called asynchrony, which makes up the most important observed variable to describe the synchronization phenomenon. Traditionally, finger tapping tasks propose time perturbations that aim to understand the underlying mechanism of error correction. These alterations are achieved by modifying the external stimulus (e.g. it’s period), which presents a limitation as this type of perturbations generates a change in the stimulus parameter (the period), as well as in the variable itself (asynchrony). This study, through the design and construction of a novel device, proposes a new class of time perturbations that originate after a change in the spatial aspects of the task. By shifting the height of the contact point, it’s possible to generate asynchronies without having to modify the stimulus’ period or to alter the period without producing a forced error. This represents a new tool for behavior characterization and the construction of correction theoretic models, as it allows to decouple the effects of traditional time perturbations. It also has implications in other sensorimotor synchronization areas, such as music production and perception, and gait coordination. These disturbances give access to states of the system that were traditionally inaccessible and solve a confounding that has persisted for decades.\nThe experiment and data acquisition where performed with arduino and Matlab, and data analysis with Matlab.\n\n\n\nVocal caricatures reveal signatures of speaker identity.\n\n\n \nLópez S.

We built a database with phrases from public figures in Argentina (originals) and copies produced by professional and amateur imitators, in two different registers: without listening to the original audio, that is, using the internal pattern that the imitator has of the character (what we will call caricatures) and the recordings recorded after listening to the original phrase (which we will call imitations). Second, this database allowed us to characterize through perceptual experiments the identity and similarity of the voice, through identification and discrimination instructions that had not been explored together, and that they are different cognitive processes.\nUsing multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques and statistical tools, we relate the perceptual space with the acoustic one, based on the main acoustics variables extracted from the audios. The identity of the speaker turned out to be best evoked by the caricatures. Furthermore, we show that the acoustic parameters shared by the caricatures and the originals correspond to the vocal tract, while those shared by imitations and originals are associated with the vocal cords.\nThese results suggest that, in analogy with visual space, one can speak of acoustic caricatures, which are intended to emphasize the identity features of the speaker, with their own formation rules and containing complex identity information."

El objetivo es ir probando diferentes funcionalidades de highcharter a medida que se van respondiendo las diferentes preguntas del documento que están todas resueltas en Actividad_3_highcharter_codigo_resuelto.Rmd.\nAlgunas observaciones más: -Por la naturaleza visual de los temas, todos los documentos .Rmd de actividades conviene seguirlos con sus respectivos .html. -Como RMarkdown también sirve para hacer presentaciones, las clases “teóricas” 1 y 2 tienen su .Rmd por si querés chusmearlos/copypastearlos. Algo similar sucede con Actividad_2_flexdashboard_consigna.Rmd que figura también como recurso extra. -Como al hacer la actividad vas a ir modificando los código base te conviene guardarte una copia en tu Home o en el mismo lugar pero con otro nombre, porque si no GIT va a sobreescribir los archivos originales si es que alguien los modifica y pushea los cambios."

March, 2023\n\n*poster (in English)\nAbstract: In Argentina, Electronic Health Records (EHR) have been continuously implemented increasing the amount of this type of data. Ethical considerations arise for their reuse to address secondary research, public health, management, and policy-making questions. Health data are sensitive data according to national and international regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.) because they can significantly impact people’s lives. Thus, having tools for effectively eliminating protected personal information (PPI) that could allow patient identification is a must. But anonymization of free text in EHR is a challenging problem because it is full of peculiarities (words outside common vocabulary, ambiguity, etc.). We are presenting our experience in developing a de-identification algorithm for free text in the EHR of a province in Argentina. We found that it is not clear to humans what information is PPI during a manual anonymization task. As expected, automatic processes also miss cases of PPI, even more than humans do. However, a simple, rule-based approach can do a good job in removing most of the PPI, outperforming a more sophisticated, machine-learning approach for low-resources contexts. Although no process can guarantee anonymization, our method can mitigate the impact of possible data breaches from highly sensitive information.\n\n\n\nAnonymization of texts from Electronic Health Records and Responsible Use of Data.\n\n\n\nPresentation at Argentine Congress of Informatics and Health.
