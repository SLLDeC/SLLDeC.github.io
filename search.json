B, 2019.\npaper code\n\nIn this paper I present part of my results from my PhD about Sensorimotor synchronization, which is one of the paradigmatic behaviors in millisecond timing, where both perception and generation of time patterns take place. Finger tapping involves a finger indicating the pulse of an external periodic stimulus, similar to when you follow the beat of the music with your foot. The time delay between the response tap and the corresponding stimulus is called asynchrony, which makes up the most important observed variable to describe the synchronization phenomenon. Traditionally, finger tapping tasks propose time perturbations that aim to understand the underlying mechanism of error correction. These alterations are achieved by modifying the external stimulus (e.g. it’s period), which presents a limitation as this type of perturbations generates a change in the stimulus parameter (the period), as well as in the variable itself (asynchrony). This study, through the design and construction of a novel device, proposes a new class of time perturbations that originate after a change in the spatial aspects of the task. By shifting the height of the contact point, it’s possible to generate asynchronies without having to modify the stimulus’ period or to alter the period without producing a forced error. This represents a new tool for behavior characterization and the construction of correction theoretic models, as it allows to decouple the effects of traditional time perturbations. It also has implications in other sensorimotor synchronization areas, such as music production and perception, and gait coordination. These disturbances give access to states of the system that were traditionally inaccessible and solve a confounding that has persisted for decades.\nThe experiment and data acquisition where performed with arduino and Matlab, and data analysis with Matlab.\n\n\n\nVocal caricatures reveal signatures of speaker identity.\nLopez S.
